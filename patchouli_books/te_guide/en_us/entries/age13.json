For similar reasons, an automated Witherfarm is recommended. Then you can start making the most powerful tools and weapons in the game as well as the biggest battery and energy storage."

The Dimension Builder is the first end game recipe and needs end game items from 8 different mods. If you're unlucky finding a Mooshroom, you may want to have a look at the Mooshroom Soul Vial recipe."
