You need to get a Tinker's Construct Smeltery and a Coke Oven for that, respectively. Before you go mining, it is recommended you make a Portal to the Mining World. The Portal needs at least 10 Portal Frames placed like a Nether Portal and activated with the Mining Multitool."

Using Tinker's Construct tools is recommended for that. As you can't craft a bucket to get lava to fire the smeltery, you can get a one time use Clay Bucket filled with Lava."

After that you need to build a Coke Oven. Coke Bricks need Seared Bricks and Lavawood which you get by pouring Lava over Wood Planks with the Smeltery. You need 27 blocks in a 3x3x3 cube, so 14 crafting recipes should do the trick. To form the multiblock you right click the center block with a Engineer's Hammer."
