So you need to start with the Heat Generator to generate power and can then work towards Solar, Wind and Bio Power (which are all heavily tweaked). Later you can use the Gas-Burning Generator, the Turbine and the Fusion Reactor for more power."

The Digital Miner, a Quarry which can target blocks, is also available and very powerful for selecting ores on planets. Fully upgraded Mekanism machines also have the capability to make auto-crafts complete nearly instantly."
