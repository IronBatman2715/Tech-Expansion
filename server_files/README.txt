//Pre-install Notes

Before you do anything, MAKE SURE JAVA IS UP TO DATE. Also make sure you have 64-bit if you have a 64-bit system.

Make sure you have enough RAM to handle the server. Be careful to not allocate too much. If you allocate all your RAM to programs(typically MC and your server), you WILL blue screen.

If you want to play with people not directly connected to the same router/internet as you, Port-forwarding is required.

//Install

Locate %Server directory%\run.bat

Right-click and edit this file and allocate the desired amount of RAM. "Xmx#G" to your desired MAX, and "Xmn##M" to your desired MIN. "G" is for gigabytes and "M" is for megabytes.

Edit %Server directory%\server.properties if so desired.

Double click the run.bat file and wait for the server to boot up.

Once the text stops moving, it is ready to be joined!

//Final Notes

Config files provided are customized to make the pack as challenging as it is. You can change some configs for performance but make sure you know what you're doing.

Let me know on the Tech Expansion CurseForge page if you find major bugs or have any recommendations for the pack. Have fun!
